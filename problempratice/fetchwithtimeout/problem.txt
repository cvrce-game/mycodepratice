Implement fetchWithTimeout (url, timeinmillisecond) that takes the url and
the time as input and returns a promise. This promise should fail if the API is not
completed in the specified time in millisecond. If it is completed. ten the promise
should resolve with the apis result.



Promise.race is a method in JavaScript that takes an iterable (usually an array) of promises and returns a single promise 
that resolves or rejects as soon as one of the input promises resolves or rejects. 
It effectively “races” all the promises and returns the result of the fastest one, whether it fulfills or fails.
